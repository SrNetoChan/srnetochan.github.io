Since many of those articles are created from an ArcGIS user point of view, they invariably lead to biased observations on QGIS lack of features. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a QGIS user perspective, so bare with me on this (a bit) long, totally and openly biased post.

Without going into detail about the differences between open source software and free software, there are several reasons why FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) interest me.

The main objective will be to register my experiences with Open Source software while addressing challenges related to geographic information systems (GIS), spatial analysis, cartography and everything else that it might entail.

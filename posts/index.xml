This year I decided to ask it again. In 2016, we add the release of the second long-term release (2.14 LTR), and two other stable versions (2.16 and 2.18).
2016 was again very productive year for the QGIS community, with lots of improvements and new features landing on QGIS source code, not to speak of all the work already in place for QGIS 3.</description></item><item><title>QGIS Features I long for while using ArcGIS</title><link>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2016-01-28-qgis-features-i-long-for-while-using-arcgis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 22:33:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2016-01-28-qgis-features-i-long-for-while-using-arcgis/</guid><description>(aka Features that ArcGIS Desktop users might not know that exists) EN | PT
From time to time, I read articles comparing ArcGIS vs QGIS. Since many of those articles are created from an ArcGIS user point of view, they invariably lead to biased observations on QGIS lack of features. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a QGIS user perspective, so bare with me on this (a bit) long, totally and openly biased post.</description></item><item><title>QGIS Top Features 2015</title><link>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2016-01-01-qgis-top-features-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 16:16:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2016-01-01-qgis-top-features-2015/</guid><description>EN | PT
With the release of the first long term release (2.8 LTR), and two other stable versions (2.10 and 2.12), 2015 was a great (and busy) year for the QGIS community, with lots of improvements and new features landing on QGIS source code.
As a balance, I have asked users to choose wich were their favorite new features during 2015 (from the visual changelogs list). As a result I got the following Top 5 features list.</description></item><item><title>New QGIS plugin - "Walking time"</title><link>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2014-03-25-novo-plugin-qgis-new-qgis-plugin-walking-time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:41:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2014-03-25-novo-plugin-qgis-new-qgis-plugin-walking-time/</guid><description>EN | PT
I have finally &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; my new plugin. I uses some quotation marks, since I believe that there is still space for a few improvement. This plugin arised with the need to calculate the travel time for the Cascais oficial pedestrian routes, and started as a simple python script. I have then decided to create a graphic interface and publish it as a plugin in the hope that someone else finds it useful.</description></item><item><title>Open Source, why?</title><link>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2013-03-31-porque-o-open-source/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 22:41:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://srnetochan.github.io/posts/2013-03-31-porque-o-open-source/</guid><description>EN | PT
During my professional and personal life, I have worked with much different software, with all kinds of licenses. Most of them would be proprietary, closed and / or commercial code. So why devote my time and learning &amp;ldquo;exclusively&amp;rdquo; to Open Source?
Without going into detail about the differences between open source software and free software, there are several reasons why FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) interest me.</description></item></channel></rss>

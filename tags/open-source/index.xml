He was a daily QGIS power user and he loved the software, but he had an itchâ€¦ Something was troubling him. As any other main character of the traditional tales, instead of looking away, he decided to accept the quest and solve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This itch of his was about the &lt;a href="www.qgis.org">QGIS&lt;/a> layout grids. It used to take Giovanni about 10 minutes to create a nice grid for a map layout, and then, another 20 minutes to replicate it a few times for different scales with small variations. If he had to do this operation one or two times every week, at the end of the year, he would have lost up to 34 hours of his precious and very limited time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

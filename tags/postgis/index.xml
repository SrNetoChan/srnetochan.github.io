Besides, I needed that they were numerically ordered starting in 1, and with the respective XY coordinates.
It seemed to be a trivial task – all I would need was to use the ST_DumpPoints() function to get all vertexes – if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that PostGIS polygons have a duplicate vertex (the last vertex must be equal to the first one) that I have no interess in showing.</description></item><item><title>Labels leading lines with QGIS and Postgis</title><link>https://srnetochan.github.io/posts/tutorials/2015-01-12-etiquetas-com-guias-em-qgis-e-postgis-labels-leading-lines-with-qgis-and-postgis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 08:00:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://srnetochan.github.io/posts/tutorials/2015-01-12-etiquetas-com-guias-em-qgis-e-postgis-labels-leading-lines-with-qgis-and-postgis/</guid><description>Recently I had the need to add labels to features with very close geometries, resulting in their collision.
Using data-defined override for label&amp;rsquo;s position (I have used layer to labeled layer plugin to set this really fast) and the QGIS tool to move labels, it was quite easy to relocate them to better places. However, in same cases, it was difficult to understand to which geometry they belonged.
I needed some kind of leading lines to connect, whenever necessary, label and feature.</description></item></channel></rss>

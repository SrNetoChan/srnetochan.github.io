# a summary about you
summary: 'I work as geospatial consultant freelancer. I have more than 20 years of working experience. On my daily work, I help others with their GIS/Geospatial challenges and workflows, mainly using QGIS, GDAL, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Python and other free and open source solutions. 


I run regular online trainings on *"Introduction to QGIS"*, *"Cartography and Datavis with QGIS"*, *"Relational Spatial Databases with QGIS and PostGIS"*, and *"Introduction to PyQGIS"*.


I firmly believe that knowledge needs to be spread as much as possible. That is why I often share tips and tutorials on my [blog](/posts), [twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexNetoGeo), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-neto-geo/). I also answer questions on [mailing lists](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user), [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/6191/alexandre-neto?tab=profile) and the [QGIS Community Telegram chat](https://t.me/+4U6j0dycRy40MTU0).


I try to be an active member of the QGIS community, where I help with documentation, testing, and Portuguese translations.'
